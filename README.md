# Nouv
The learning app that helps you learn anything you want.

## Description
This is a project to help people learn better.
It's main features are the ability to create and share levels of learning, and to subscribe to courses that other people have created.

The point being that you can learn anything you want, and you can help others learn what you know.

The main reason for this project is that I would love to have an App like Duolingo but for university subjects, and since I'd have to create a nice way of adding content to it anyway, I thought why not make it a platform for everyone to use - so here we are.

## Open Source & Contributions
This project is 100% open source. 
Please don't judge my code too harshly, I'm on a tight schedule and I'm doing my best.

If you want to contribute, please do. I'm happy to accept any help I can get.
Easiest way is to test the app and report bugs, but if you want to help with code, that's great too.
