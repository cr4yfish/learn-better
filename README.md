## Description
This is a project to help people learn better. Its main feature is the ability to create and share courses.
The point being that you can learn anything you want, and you can help others learn what you know.

The main reason for this project is that I would love to have an App like Duolingo but for university subjects, and since I'd have to create a nice way of adding content to it anyway, I thought why not make it a platform for everyone to use, I thought why not make it a platform for everyone to use - so here we are.

### Paywall features (these cost significant money to run)
These features will be locked either behind a payment plan or by letting users provide their API keys (e.g. for OpenAI).
Since it's open source the 2nd option will be available anyway for tech-users.
Right now I prefer the first option since it might also help pay for server cost.

- [x] Creating Levels & Questions from Document uploads using AI (PDF only right now)?
- [ ] ~~Creating Levels & Questions from Pictures of Documents?~~ <- Pretty expensive
- [ ] ~~AI Helper for creating questions & levels (mostly for writing help)~~ Just use the first feature

## Open Source & Contributions
This project is 100% open source. 
Please don't judge my code too harshly, I'm on a tight schedule and I'm doing my best.

If you want to contribute, please do. I'm happy to accept any help I can get.
Easiest way is to test the app and report bugs, but if you want to help with code, that's great too.
